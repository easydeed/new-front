## üéØ **CRITICAL: CYPRESS TEST EXECUTION**

### **Status**: ‚è≥ **REQUIRED BEFORE DEPLOYMENT**

> "Cypress/UAT: Production smoke suite (limited set) verifying core scenarios with production feature flags enabled."

### **How to Execute**

#### **Step 1: Start Development Server**
```powershell
# Terminal 1
cd frontend
npm run dev

# Wait for: "ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000"
```

#### **Step 2: Run Cypress Tests**
```powershell
# Terminal 2 (from project root)
.\scripts\run-cypress-phase5-tests.ps1

# Or manually:
cd frontend
npx cypress run --spec cypress/e2e/wizard-regression-pack.cy.js
```

#### **Step 3: Review Results**
- Check console output for pass/fail
- Review screenshots: `frontend/cypress/screenshots/`
- Review videos: `frontend/cypress/videos/`
- Verify all 11 test groups pass

#### **Step 4: Capture Sign-Off Evidence**
- Document results in `docs/roadmap/PHASE5_CYPRESS_SIGNOFF_EVIDENCE.md`
- Commit test artifacts (if needed)
- Get stakeholder sign-off

### **Expected Test Groups** (11 total)
1. ‚úì Landing Page & Navigation
2. ‚úì Dynamic Wizard Flow
3. ‚úì Legacy Wizard Fallback
4. ‚úì Error Handling & Resilience
5. ‚úì Feature Flag Resilience
6. ‚úì Mobile & Responsive Testing
7. ‚úì PDF Download Verification
8. ‚úì Performance & Loading
9. ‚úì Form Validation
10. ‚úì Loading States
11. ‚úì API Failures

## üöÄ **DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW**

### **Per Wizard Rebuild Plan - Phase 5 Deployment Steps**

### **STAGING** (Already Active)

#### **Render (Backend)**
**Per Wizard Rebuild Plan**:
> "Monitor high-priority metrics (latency, error rates, queue depth) for 24h burn-in."

- [x] Final rehearsal using production-like data
- [x] Monitoring started (Hour 2+ of 24)
- [ ] 24-hour burn-in completed
- [ ] Metrics review: latency <1s, error rate 0%, no anomalies

#### **Vercel (Frontend)**
**Per Wizard Rebuild Plan**:
> "Validate feature flag sequencing via LaunchDarkly (or equivalent). Run final Cypress regression and capture sign-off evidence."

- [x] Staging deployment operational
- [ ] Feature flag sequencing validated
- [ ] Final Cypress regression executed
- [ ] Sign-off evidence captured

---

### **PRODUCTION** (After Burn-In & Tests)

#### **Render (Backend)**
**Per Wizard Rebuild Plan**:
> "Deploy final image. Apply outstanding migrations (if any) during low-traffic window. Turn on `DYNAMIC_WIZARD_ENABLED=true` and monitor logs/APM for first-hour anomalies. Set rollback checkpoint at 30 minutes."

**Steps**:
1. [ ] Deploy final image to Render
2. [ ] Verify no outstanding migrations (N/A for this deployment)
3. [ ] Enable `DYNAMIC_WIZARD_ENABLED=true`
4. [ ] Monitor logs/APM for first hour
5. [ ] Set 30-minute rollback checkpoint
6. [ ] Verify all routes operational

**Monitoring Thresholds**:
- Response time: <5s target
- Error rate: <2% acceptable, <1% target
- Uptime: >99.9%

#### **Vercel (Frontend)**
**Per Wizard Rebuild Plan**:
> "Promote release. Enable feature flags incrementally (10% ‚Üí 50% ‚Üí 100%) while watching real-time analytics. If metrics regress, toggle flags off and redeploy prior build."

**Steps**:
1. [ ] Promote release to production
2. [ ] **Option A**: Gradual rollout with flags
   - [ ] Enable 10% traffic
   - [ ] Monitor for 1 hour
   - [ ] Scale to 50% traffic
   - [ ] Monitor for 1 hour
   - [ ] Scale to 100% traffic
3. [ ] **Option B**: Full deployment (if flag doesn't control selection)
   - [ ] Deploy to 100%
   - [ ] Monitor closely for first hour
4. [ ] Watch real-time analytics
5. [ ] Monitor user funnels, API errors, business KPIs

**Monitoring Thresholds**:
- User conversion: No >20% drop
- Wizard completion: >80% rate
- Error overlay: <5% users
- Support tickets: No significant increase

---

## üö® **ROLLBACK PROCEDURES**

### **Immediate Rollback** (<5 minutes)
**Per Wizard Rebuild Plan**:
> "Ability to toggle flags (`DYNAMIC_WIZARD_ENABLED`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_DYNAMIC_WIZARD`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_TITLEPOINT_ENABLED`) within minutes."

**Triggers**:
- Error rate >5% for >15 minutes
- Response time >2x baseline for >10 minutes
- User conversion drop >20%
- Critical functionality failure

**Steps**:
```powershell
# 1. Toggle feature flags via Vercel dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_DYNAMIC_WIZARD=false

# 2. Verify legacy wizard functional
# 3. Monitor error rates return to baseline
```

### **Full Rollback** (<30 minutes)
**Per Wizard Rebuild Plan**:
> "Documented process to redeploy previous Vercel build and Render image."

**Steps**:
```powershell
# 1. Revert Vercel deployment
vercel rollback <previous-deployment-url>

# 2. Revert Render deployment (if needed - unlikely)
# Via Render dashboard: Rollback to previous deployment

# 3. Verify system functionality
# 4. Run smoke tests
# 5. Monitor for 1 hour
```
