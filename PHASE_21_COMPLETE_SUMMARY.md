## 🎓 **KEY LESSONS DOCUMENTED**

### **1. SiteX Field Mapping** (Phase 16-19)
- ✅ Legal Description: NESTED in `LegalDescriptionInfo.LegalBriefDescription`
- ✅ County: `CountyName` or `SiteCountyName` (NOT `County`)
- ✅ Always check actual API response, never assume

### **2. PDF Generation Patterns** (Phase 19)
- ✅ Use permissive Pydantic validators (allow empty fields)
- ✅ Always pass `now()` and `datetime` to Jinja context
- ✅ Support 3 docType formats (canonical, snake_case, hyphenated)

### **3. State Management** (Phase 19)
- ✅ REPLACE state, don't MERGE (prevents data persistence bugs)
- ✅ Each wizard mode needs its own localStorage key
- ✅ Clear session after successful finalization

### **4. Wizard Architecture** (Phase 14-19)
- ✅ Modern = Prompt-driven, canonical adapters
- ✅ Classic = Step-by-step, context builders
- ✅ Both use SiteX hydration for property enrichment

### **5. Session Management** (Phase 19)
- ✅ Clear correct wizard key after finalization
- ✅ Use sessionStorage flags for one-time actions
- ✅ Don't preserve old data across new deed sessions
