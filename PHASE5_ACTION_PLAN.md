### **TASK 5: Production Feature Flag Rollout** ⏳

**Status**: PENDING (after GO decision)  
**ETA**: October 2, 2025 at 15:00 PT  
**Owner**: DevOps + PM  

**Prerequisites**:
- ✅ GO decision made
- ✅ All previous tasks complete
- ✅ Monitoring dashboards ready
- ✅ Team on standby for monitoring

**Rollout Strategy** (Gradual):

#### **Stage 1: Dark Launch** (0% users - 1 hour)
```yaml
Time: Oct 2, 15:00 PT
Duration: 1 hour

Backend (Render):
  DYNAMIC_WIZARD_ENABLED: false → true

Frontend (Vercel):
  NEXT_PUBLIC_DYNAMIC_WIZARD: false (keep disabled)

What This Does:
  - Backend ready but wizard not visible to users
  - Final production smoke test with test accounts
  - Monitor backend for issues

Monitor:
  - Backend health endpoint
  - API response times
  - Error rates in logs
  - No user impact (feature still disabled)

Success Criteria:
  - No backend errors
  - Performance stable
  - Ready for user rollout
```

#### **Stage 2: Canary** (10% users - 2 hours)
```yaml
Time: Oct 2, 16:00 PT (after 1h dark launch)
Duration: 2 hours

Frontend (Vercel):
  NEXT_PUBLIC_DYNAMIC_WIZARD: false → true (10% rollout)

How to Enable 10%:
  1. Vercel Dashboard → Project → Settings → Environment Variables
  2. Edit NEXT_PUBLIC_DYNAMIC_WIZARD
  3. Set value: "true"
  4. Save
  5. Redeploy: Dashboard → Deployments → Latest → Redeploy
  
  Note: For true 10% rollout, use LaunchDarkly or similar.
  For simple rollout, enable for all or none.

What This Does:
  - Dynamic wizard visible to 10% of users
  - Majority still see old flow
  - Monitor closely for issues

Monitor:
  - User completion rates
  - Error rates (should be <1%)
  - API latency (should be <2s)
  - User feedback/complaints
  - PDF generation success rate

Success Criteria:
  - <1% error rate
  - No user complaints
  - Metrics stable or improving
  - No rollback needed

Rollback If:
  - Error rate >2%
  - Performance degrades >50%
  - Multiple user complaints
  - Critical bug discovered
```

#### **Stage 3: Half Rollout** (50% users - 4 hours)
```yaml
Time: Oct 2, 18:00 PT (after 2h canary)
Duration: 4 hours

Frontend (Vercel):
  NEXT_PUBLIC_DYNAMIC_WIZARD: 10% → 50%

Monitor:
  - Same metrics as canary
  - Larger sample size for confidence

Success Criteria:
  - Error rate remains <1%
  - Performance stable
  - Positive or neutral user sentiment

Rollback If:
  - Error rate >1.5%
  - Performance issues
  - Business KPIs drop
```

#### **Stage 4: Full Rollout** (100% users - 24 hours)
```yaml
Time: Oct 2, 22:00 PT (after 4h half rollout)
Duration: 24 hours (monitoring period)

Frontend (Vercel):
  NEXT_PUBLIC_DYNAMIC_WIZARD: 50% → 100%

What This Does:
  - All users see dynamic wizard
  - Old wizard deprecated
  - Full production

Monitor:
  - First hour: Very closely
  - Next 23 hours: Regular monitoring
  - Look for any delayed issues

Success Criteria:
  - Error rate <0.5%
  - Performance meeting SLAs
  - User satisfaction maintained
  - Business KPIs stable/improving

Rollback If:
  - Critical issues discovered
  - Widespread user complaints
  - Performance unacceptable
```

#### **Stage 5: Monitoring & Cleanup** (72 hours)
```yaml
Time: Oct 3-5, 2025
Duration: 3 days

What to Do:
  - Continue monitoring metrics
  - Address any minor issues
  - Collect user feedback
  - Document lessons learned

After 72h of Stability:
  - Consider Phase 5 COMPLETE
  - Archive old wizard code
  - Update documentation
  - Celebrate! 🎉
```

**Rollout Commands**:

```bash
# Vercel (Frontend)
# Via Dashboard:
# 1. Settings → Environment Variables
# 2. Change NEXT_PUBLIC_DYNAMIC_WIZARD value
# 3. Redeploy

# Render (Backend)
# Via Dashboard:
# 1. Environment tab
# 2. Change DYNAMIC_WIZARD_ENABLED to true
# 3. Service restarts automatically

# Rollback (If needed)
# Vercel: Deployments → Previous deployment → "Promote to Production"
# Render: Events → Previous deployment → "Rollback to this deploy"
```

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Dark launch successful (1 hour)
- [ ] Canary rollout successful (10%, 2 hours)
- [ ] Half rollout successful (50%, 4 hours)
- [ ] Full rollout successful (100%, 24 hours)
- [ ] 72-hour stability confirmed
- [ ] Phase 5 COMPLETE ✅
