# Phase 17 Facelift - Rollback Instructions

**Date**: October 23, 2025  

---

## 🔄 If You Don't Like The New Landing Page

### Quick Rollback Options:

---

## Option 1: Git Revert (Easiest)

```bash
# Revert the landing page commit
git log --oneline  # Find the facelift commit
git revert <commit-hash>
git push origin main
```

---

## Option 2: Restore from Backup

```bash
# Copy backup back to main location
copy "frontend\src\app\_legacy-landing\page.tsx" "frontend\src\app\page.tsx"

# Commit the restoration
git add frontend/src/app/page.tsx
git commit -m "revert: Restore original landing page"
git push origin main
```

---

## Option 3: Delete Feature Branch (If Not Merged)

```bash
# If still on feature branch and haven't merged:
git checkout main
git branch -D feat/landing-livecopy
```

---

## 📋 Backup Location

**Original landing page backed up at:**
`frontend/src/app/_legacy-landing/page.tsx`

---

## ⚠️ What Gets Rolled Back

- ✅ Landing page visual design
- ✅ New components (if not used elsewhere)
- ❌ Dependencies (lucide-react, framer-motion) - keep installed, they don't hurt

---

## 🎯 Dependencies Added (Safe to Keep)

These packages are useful and don't break anything:
- `lucide-react` - Icon library
- `framer-motion` - Animation library  
- `@tailwindcss/typography` - Typography styles

**You can keep them even if you rollback the landing page.**

---

## 🔍 Verify Rollback Worked

After rollback:
1. Go to https://deedpro-frontend-new.vercel.app/
2. Should see original landing page
3. All other routes should work normally

**Backup created**: `frontend/src/app/_legacy-landing/page.tsx` ✅
