# ‚úÖ **GRANTOR_NAME FIX - TESTING CHECKLIST**

## üéØ **WHAT WAS FIXED**
- ‚úÖ Frontend now sends `grantor_name` in finalize payload
- ‚úÖ Backend now inserts `grantor_name` into database
- ‚úÖ Deployed to production (auto-deploy triggered)

---

## üìä **TESTING PLAN**

### **Test 1: Quitclaim Deed (The Failing Case)**
**Priority**: P0 - This was the exact error

1. Go to: https://deedpro-check.vercel.app/login
2. Login: `test@deedpro-check.com / TestPassword123!`
3. Click **"Create Deed"** ‚Üí Select **"Quitclaim Deed"**
4. **Step 1: Property Search**
   - Enter: `8381-021-001` (or any valid APN)
   - Click "Search Property"
   - Verify SiteX data loads (property address, APN, county)
5. **Step 4: Parties & Property**
   - **Verify**: Grantor field is auto-filled from SiteX owner data
   - **Or**: Manually enter a grantor name (e.g., "John Doe")
   - Enter grantee name (e.g., "Jane Smith")
6. **Step 5: Preview**
   - Click "Generate PDF Preview"
   - Click "Finalize & Save to Dashboard"

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ No 500 error
- ‚úÖ Success message: "Deed finalized and saved successfully!"
- ‚úÖ Redirect to Past Deeds
- ‚úÖ Deed appears in Past Deeds with grantor name visible

**What to Check in Render Logs**:
```
[Phase 11] Inserting deed with data: user_id=6, deed_type=quitclaim, 
  property_address=..., apn=8381-021-001, grantor_name=John Doe  ‚Üê SHOULD NOW EXIST!
[Phase 11] Deed created successfully: <deed_id>
```

---

### **Test 2: Interspousal Transfer Deed**
Same steps as above, select "Interspousal Transfer Deed"

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ Grantor field auto-fills from SiteX
- ‚úÖ Finalize saves without error
- ‚úÖ Appears in Past Deeds

---

### **Test 3: Warranty Deed**
Same steps as above, select "Warranty Deed"

---

### **Test 4: Tax Deed**
Same steps as above, select "Tax Deed"

---

### **Test 5: Grant Deed (Regression Check)**
Same steps as above, select "Grant Deed"

**Why**: Ensure we didn't break Grant Deed (which was working before)

---

## üîç **WHERE TO CHECK GRANTOR DATA**

### **1. Past Deeds Page**
- Go to: https://deedpro-check.vercel.app/past-deeds
- Find your newly created deed
- **Verify**: Grantor name is displayed (not blank or NULL)

### **2. Database (If Needed)**
If you have database access, check:
```sql
SELECT id, deed_type, grantor_name, grantee_name, property_address, status, created_at
FROM deeds
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Expected**:
- `grantor_name` column is populated (not NULL)

### **3. Render Logs**
Go to: https://dashboard.render.com ‚Üí Your backend service ‚Üí Logs

Look for:
```
[Phase 11] Inserting deed with data: ..., grantor_name=<ACTUAL NAME>, ...
[Phase 11] Deed created successfully: <deed_id>
```

---

## ‚ùå **IF YOU STILL SEE ERRORS**

### **Error 1: Still Getting 500 Error**
Check Render logs for exact error message.

### **Error 2: Grantor field is blank in wizard**
**Issue**: SiteX data not loading or not returning owner information
**Fix**: Check Step 1 property search is working and SiteX API is responding

### **Error 3: Grantor is NULL in database**
**Issue**: Context adapter not extracting grantor
**Debug**: Check browser console for the finalize payload:
```javascript
[Phase 11] Saving deed metadata: { ..., grantor_name: "...", ... }
```

If `grantor_name` is empty in payload, the issue is frontend data flow.

---

## üéä **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

All tests pass when:
- [x] No 500 errors during finalize
- [x] Grantor name appears in Past Deeds
- [x] Render logs show grantor_name in INSERT
- [x] Database has non-NULL grantor_name
- [x] All 5 deed types work (Quitclaim, Interspousal, Warranty, Tax, Grant)

---

## üìù **WHAT TO REPORT BACK**

Please provide:
1. ‚úÖ / ‚ùå for each test (Quitclaim, Interspousal, Warranty, Tax, Grant)
2. Screenshot of Past Deeds showing the new deed with grantor name
3. Any Render log errors (if failures occur)

---

**Deploy Status**: ‚úÖ DEPLOYED (Waiting for Vercel + Render auto-deploy to finish ~3-5 min)

**Next**: Test 1 Quitclaim deed ‚Üí Report results ‚Üí Proceed to other tests if successful
