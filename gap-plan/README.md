# DeedPro — Phase 7 Notifications & Deed Sharing (Cursor Bundle)
Version: 1.0.0
Date: 2025-10-11

This bundle wires **system notifications**, **deed sharing & tracking**, and a **two‑stage Finalize flow** into the unified wizard — without touching your crown‑jewel business logic.

It is designed to drop into your repo (Next.js + FastAPI) and align with the routes in `backend/main.py` and existing routers.

> Safe by default: Everything ships behind feature flags. If the flags are off, existing behavior is unchanged.
