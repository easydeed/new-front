## üéØ Documentation Philosophy: "Slow and Steady Wins the Race"

### Why We Document Minor Issues

**Problem**: In fast-paced development, minor edge cases can:
1. Be forgotten after a few weeks
2. Resurface as "mysterious bugs" later
3. Waste hours of debugging time
4. Create frustration when root cause isn't obvious

**Solution**: Document **NOW** while context is fresh:
- What the edge case is
- Why it exists (design choice vs limitation)
- Probability of occurrence
- Exact fix if it surfaces
- File location and line numbers

### Benefits

1. **Fast Backtracking**: If issue surfaces, we know EXACTLY where to look
2. **Context Preservation**: Future developers understand the "why"
3. **Confidence**: Known risks are managed risks
4. **No Surprises**: Team is aware of potential issues upfront

## üìö Known Minor Issues (Phase 18 v2)

### Issue #1: Model Class Detection Heuristic
```javascript
// What: Script uses regex to find Pydantic classes
const classRe = /class\s+([A-Za-z_]\w*)(?:\([^)]*\))?\s*:\s*\n/gm;
if (!/Deed|Context/i.test(cls)) return match; // Could miss edge cases
```

**Documented**:
- **Risk**: Could miss unconventionally named classes (e.g., `QuitclaimDocument`)
- **Probability**: Very Low (<5%)
- **Mitigation**: Has safe fallback (appends to EOF with warning)
- **Fix**: Manual insertion of `requested_by` field
- **File**: `phase18-v2/scripts/apply_phase17_all_deeds_v2.mjs` lines 79-107

**Why This Matters**: If a future deed type is named differently, we won't waste time debugging‚Äîwe'll immediately check this documented issue.

---

### Issue #2: Template `<body>` Tag Assumption
```javascript
// What: Script injects header after <body> tag
const bodyMatch = code.match(/<body[^>]*>/i);
if (!bodyMatch) {
  if (STRICT) throw new Error('No <body> tag');
  warn('Skipping template');
  return;
}
```

**Documented**:
- **Risk**: STRICT mode will fail on non-HTML templates
- **Probability**: Very Low (all current deed templates are HTML)
- **Mitigation**: BY DESIGN - non-HTML templates need manual review
- **Fix**: Set `STRICT=0` and manually add header block
- **File**: `phase18-v2/scripts/apply_phase17_all_deeds_v2.mjs` lines 134-142

**Why This Matters**: If we ever create a plain text deed template, we'll know why the script fails and how to handle it.

---

### Issue #3: Manual Adapter Review Required
```typescript
// What: No automated adapter patching
// adapters/manual_adapter_checklist.md provides exact snippets
requestedBy: canonical?.requestedBy ?? opts?.state?.requestedBy ?? '',
```

**Documented**:
- **Risk**: Developer might skip manual review step
- **Probability**: Low (if workflow followed)
- **Mitigation**: Checklist provided, verify script checks for `requestedBy`
- **Fix**: Run `report_adapters_v2.mjs` to identify gaps
- **File**: `phase18-v2/adapters/manual_adapter_checklist.md`

**Why This Matters**: If a deed type's PDF doesn't show "Requested By", we'll immediately check if the adapter review was completed.

## üìñ How to Use This Documentation

### Scenario 1: Bug Report - "Quitclaim deed PDF missing 'Requested By'"
**Steps**:
1. Check `PROJECT_STATUS.md` ‚Üí "KNOWN MINOR ISSUES" section
2. See Issue #3: "Manual Adapter Review Required"
3. Run: `node phase18-v2/scripts/report_adapters_v2.mjs .`
4. Follow: `phase18-v2/adapters/manual_adapter_checklist.md`
5. **Total debug time**: 5 minutes (instead of 1-2 hours)

### Scenario 2: Script Warning - "could not locate a Deed/Context class"
**Steps**:
1. Check `PROJECT_STATUS.md` ‚Üí "KNOWN MINOR ISSUES" section
2. See Issue #1: "Model Class Detection Heuristic"
3. Open: `phase18-v2/scripts/apply_phase17_all_deeds_v2.mjs` lines 79-107
4. Manually insert `requested_by` field in the model
5. **Total debug time**: 3 minutes (instead of 30 minutes)

### Scenario 3: New Developer Onboarding
**Steps**:
1. Read: `PROJECT_STATUS.md`
2. See: "üéØ QUICK REFERENCE: Known Minor Issues (Non-Blockers)"
3. Understand: All edge cases are documented with exact fixes
4. **Result**: Confidence to deploy, knowing risks are managed
