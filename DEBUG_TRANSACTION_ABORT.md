# üö® Database Transaction Abort - Debug Analysis

**Date**: October 14, 2025 at 5:31 PM ET (2:31 PM PT)  
**Severity**: CRITICAL - Server partially down  
**Status**: Investigating

---

## üìä LOG ANALYSIS

### **Timeline of Events**

**17:08 - 17:30**: Normal operations
- Multiple `/notifications/unread-count` requests (401 Unauthorized - expected for polling without auth)
- Multiple `/pricing` OPTIONS requests (200 OK - CORS preflight)
- No errors

**17:31:20 - FIRST ERROR**:
```
[PRICING ERROR] current transaction is aborted, commands ignored until end of transaction block
INFO: 12.7.76.75:0 - "GET /pricing HTTP/1.1" 500 Internal Server Error
```

**17:31:33 - CASCADE FAILURE**:
```
[LOGIN ERROR] current transaction is aborted, commands ignored until end of transaction block
INFO: 12.7.76.75:0 - "POST /users/login HTTP/1.1" 500 Internal Server Error
```

**17:32:05 - CONTINUED FAILURE**:
```
[LOGIN ERROR] current transaction is aborted, commands ignored until end of transaction block
INFO: 12.7.76.75:0 - "POST /users/login HTTP/1.1" 500 Internal Server Error
```

## üîç ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### **Problem**: PostgreSQL Transaction Poisoning

**What's Happening**:
1. ‚úÖ Some endpoint executes a database query that fails
2. ‚ùå The transaction is aborted by PostgreSQL
3. ‚ùå The code does NOT call `conn.rollback()` in the except block
4. ‚ùå The database connection remains "poisoned"
5. ‚ùå ALL subsequent queries on that connection fail with "current transaction is aborted"

**This is the SAME issue we fixed yesterday** in the rejection bundle (`backend/main.py` `/approve/{token}` endpoint).

---

## üéØ SUSPECTED CULPRITS

### **Suspect #1: `/pricing` Endpoint** üî¥ MOST LIKELY

**Evidence**:
- First error occurred at `/pricing` endpoint
- User's IP: `12.7.76.75` (likely the user testing)
- Error message: `[PRICING ERROR] current transaction is aborted...`

**Likely Location**:
- `backend/main.py` - `/pricing` route
- OR `backend/routers/*.py` - pricing router

**Issue**: Probably has database query without proper rollback in except block

---

### **Suspect #2: `/users/login` Endpoint** üü° SECONDARY VICTIM

**Evidence**:
- Failed AFTER `/pricing` error
- Same error: `[LOGIN ERROR] current transaction is aborted...`
- User trying to log in after pricing page failed

**Likely Cause**: Using the same poisoned database connection from the `/pricing` error

---

## üî¨ YESTERDAY'S CHANGES REVIEW

### **Did Phase 14 (Frontend Sidebar) Cause This?**
**‚ùå NO** - Phase 14 only changed frontend React components, no backend changes.

**Files Modified Yesterday (Phase 14)**:
- ‚úÖ `frontend/src/app/create-deed/page.tsx` - Frontend only, no backend impact
- ‚úÖ `docs/*.md` - Documentation only

**Verdict**: Phase 14 is NOT the cause.

---

### **Did Rejection Bundle (Phase 7.5 Part 2) Cause This?**
**‚ö†Ô∏è POSSIBLY RELATED** - We fixed this SAME issue in one endpoint, but may have missed others.

**What We Fixed Yesterday**:
- ‚úÖ `backend/main.py` - `/approve/{token}` endpoint - Added `conn.rollback()` in except block
- ‚úÖ Transaction management for notification creation

**What We Might Have Missed**:
- ‚ùå Other endpoints that use database connections
- ‚ùå `/pricing` endpoint
- ‚ùå Possibly other routers

## üõ†Ô∏è REQUIRED FIXES

### **Fix #1: Add Rollback to `/pricing` Endpoint** üî¥ URGENT

**Pattern to Fix**:
```python
# BEFORE (BAD):
try:
    cur = conn.cursor(cursor_factory=RealDictCursor)
    cur.execute("SELECT * FROM pricing")
    # ... handle results
except Exception as e:
    # ‚ùå NO ROLLBACK - Connection is poisoned!
    return {"error": str(e)}

# AFTER (GOOD):
try:
    cur = conn.cursor(cursor_factory=RealDictCursor)
    cur.execute("SELECT * FROM pricing")
    # ... handle results
except Exception as e:
    conn.rollback()  # ‚úÖ Critical! Unpoisoned the connection
    return {"error": str(e)}
```

---

### **Fix #2: Audit ALL Endpoints with Database Queries**

**Need to Check**:
1. ‚ùå `/pricing` - Confirmed broken
2. ‚ùå `/users/login` - Likely victim of poisoned connection
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è `/deeds/*` - Unknown
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è `/admin/*` - Unknown
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è `/shared-deeds` - Fixed yesterday
6. ‚úÖ `/approve/{token}` - Fixed yesterday

---

## üöë IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

### **Step 1: Find `/pricing` Endpoint** ‚è≥ NOW
Search codebase for `/pricing` route definition

### **Step 2: Add Rollback** ‚è≥ NOW
Add `conn.rollback()` to all except blocks that use database connections

### **Step 3: Test Locally** ‚è≥ 5 MIN
Simulate error and verify rollback works

### **Step 4: Deploy** ‚è≥ 10 MIN
Commit + push fix

### **Step 5: Restart Render** ‚è≥ IMMEDIATE
May need to restart to clear poisoned connections

### **Step 6: Audit All Endpoints** ‚è≥ 30 MIN
Systematic review of ALL database-using endpoints

---

## üìã SUCCESS CRITERIA

- ‚úÖ `/pricing` endpoint has rollback in except block
- ‚úÖ `/users/login` endpoint has rollback in except block
- ‚úÖ All endpoints with DB queries have rollback
- ‚úÖ No more "current transaction is aborted" errors
- ‚úÖ User can successfully load pricing page
- ‚úÖ User can successfully log in

---

## üéØ PREVENTION

### **Long-term Fix**: Connection Pool Management
Consider using a connection pool that automatically rolls back on error:
- SQLAlchemy with proper session management
- OR explicit `with conn:` context managers
- OR middleware that ensures rollback on any exception
