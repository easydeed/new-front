# PrefillCombo Input Fix - Phase 16.2

**Date**: October 23, 2025  
**Status**: 🟡 READY TO DEPLOY

---

## 🐛 Root Cause Identified

**File**: `frontend/src/features/wizard/mode/components/PrefillCombo.tsx`  
**Issue**: Input field's `onChange` handler only updated local `draft` state but never called parent `onChange` prop

### Before (BROKEN):
```typescript
<input
  value={draft}
  onChange={(e) => setDraft(e.target.value)}  // ❌ Only local state
  placeholder={`Type or pick…`}
/>
```

### After (FIXED):
```typescript
<input
  value={draft}
  onChange={(e) => {
    const newValue = e.target.value;
    setDraft(newValue);
    onChange(newValue);  // ✅ Calls parent onChange
  }}
  placeholder={`Type or pick…`}
/>
```

## 🎯 What This Fixes

### Issue #1: Requested By field
- ❌ **Before**: User types "John Smith" → value lost → doesn't appear on PDF
- ✅ **After**: User types "John Smith" → value saved → appears on PDF

### Issue #2: Grantor field (also affected!)
- ❌ **Before**: User types grantor name → value lost if they don't click dropdown
- ✅ **After**: User types grantor name → value saved immediately

## 📊 Impact Analysis

### Fields Using PrefillCombo:
1. **Grantor** (`grantorName`) - ✅ Fixed
2. **Requested By** (`requestedBy`) - ✅ Fixed

### User Actions Now Supported:
- ✅ Type in field and press Tab/Enter → **Saves**
- ✅ Type in field and click Next → **Saves**
- ✅ Click dropdown item → **Saves** (already worked)
- ✅ Click "Add new partner" → **Saves** (already worked)

## 🔍 Why User Reported "Only First Name"

The wizard actually asks **"Who is requesting the recording?"** with a full-width text field. The user can type:
- ✅ Full name: "John Smith"
- ✅ Name + company: "John Smith - ABC Title"
- ✅ Just company: "ABC Title Company"

**There is no separate "first name" field** - it's a single text input for the full name/company.

The user probably thought they could only enter first name because:
1. The dropdown showed partner names (company names)
2. They might have been confused about what to enter
3. But the field accepts **any text** - full names, companies, etc.
