# Owner ledger — canonical open/closed list

**This file is the ledger.** Agent reports cite it; corrections land HERE
(not only in chat) so the list survives context windows. No credential
values ever appear in this file — item names and status only.

_Last corrected: 2026-07-30 (owner corrections relayed post-wave-1)._

## Open — owner's card

- **Demo password rotation** (X0 follow-up).
- **Junk seed cleanup** (test rows in production data).
- **TitlePoint / SiteX credential rotations.**
- **DTT city-rates review** (`frontend/src/lib/dttCalc.ts`) — owner's
  escrow review is authoritative.
- **HM2 inputs**: sales/contact email → `CONTACT_SALES_EMAIL` constant;
  footer entity details.
- **Counsel review** of the DRAFT `/terms` + `/privacy` pages.
- **PDFShift account closure** (code removal shipped in PR #71; Render
  env vars `PDFSHIFT_API_KEY`/`PDF_ENGINE` deletion rides with it).
- **Full/Partial Reconveyance — HOLD** (wave-2 ruling): lender-side
  paper adjacent to Tier C; needs a separate owner decision before any
  build. Not part of wave 2.

## Closed — do not re-report

- **SendGrid** — RESOLVED 2026-07-30: `info@deedpro.io` verified, key
  refreshed, production share test green with delivery confirmed.
- **W0 §3** — DECIDED: **Model 2 = confirmation in our UI** (corrected
  2026-07-30; an earlier ledger entry inverted this as "asserted
  confirmations" — the owner's definition governs). PR #79 closed as
  decided; the W1 draft stays parked pending the owner's lane call.
- **Demo-card Vercel env vars** — closed 2026-07-30: owner has not
  requested the demo card back; reopen only on owner request.
- **PS2/PS3 engine flip** — WeasyPrint sole engine; production parity
  PASSED; PDFShift code removed (account closure remains open, above).
- **T7 drops** — done (owner-executed).
- **HM2 copy** — approved as-is and merged (#75).
- **Wave-1 rulings** — all implemented as structural pins (fixed-vesting
  furniture; blank execution marks; parties-JSONB migration; declaration
  family; FORMS_TRIAGE correction note).

## Ledgered triggers (machine-side, fire on condition)

- ~~Parties JSONB migration~~ — FIRED and executed (PR #86).
- **"Compact chassis" CSS variant** — consider if more one-page
  instruments accumulate (spike report note; the inline-acknowledgment
  mode of PR #87 covers the current cases).
