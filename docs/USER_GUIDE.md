## ü§ñ **AI Assistant Features**

### **Natural Language Interface**

The AI Assistant is your personal legal document expert. You can ask questions in plain English and get intelligent responses:

#### **Example Conversations:**

**User**: "What information do I need for the grantor?"
**AI**: "For the grantor section, you'll need the complete legal names exactly as they appear on the current title or deed. This includes any suffixes (Jr., Sr., III) and the vesting type (a single man, a married woman, etc.). I can help you format this correctly if you provide the names."

**User**: "How do I calculate the documentary transfer tax?"
**AI**: "I can calculate the DTT automatically! Just enter the sale price and I'll compute the tax based on your property location. For Los Angeles County, the rate is $1.10 per $1,000 of consideration. Would you like me to calculate this for you?"

**User**: "Should I use a Grant Deed or Quitclaim Deed?"
**AI**: "That depends on your situation. If you're selling to an unrelated party and want to provide warranty protection, use a Grant Deed. If you're transferring within family or clearing title issues and don't need warranties, a Quitclaim Deed might be appropriate. Can you tell me more about your transfer?"

#### **Smart Suggestions**

The AI provides contextual suggestions throughout the process:

- **Field Completion**: "Based on the property address, I found the APN is 123-456-789. Would you like me to fill this in?"
- **Error Prevention**: "The grantor name format looks unusual. Legal names typically include vesting information like 'a single man' or 'husband and wife as joint tenants'."
- **Process Guidance**: "You're ready to move to the next step! I've verified all required information is complete and properly formatted."

### **Chain of Title Integration**

#### **Automatic Property Research**
When you enter a property address or APN, the system can automatically:

- **Retrieve Property History**: See previous transfers and ownership changes
- **Identify Potential Issues**: Flag unusual ownership patterns or title problems
- **Verify Current Ownership**: Confirm the grantor information matches records
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate potential title issues and their severity

#### **Risk Analysis Features**

- **Ownership Pattern Analysis**: Flags unusual ownership structures
