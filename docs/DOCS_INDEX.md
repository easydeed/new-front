## Legacy Archive
The 2025 overhaul marketing collateral, dynamic-wizard walkthroughs, and the original architecture plan now live in [`docs/archive/2025-overhaul/`](./archive/2025-overhaul/). Consult that folder only when historical context is required; all active work should rely on the core references above.
