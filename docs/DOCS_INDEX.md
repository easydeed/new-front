## Core Canon (2025 Reset)
| Focus | Document | Summary |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Crisis report | [wizard-catastrophes.md](./wizard-catastrophes.md) | Non-negotiable legal and UX failures that shape every rebuild decision. |
| Backend routes | [backend/ROUTES.md](./backend/ROUTES.md) | Authoritative FastAPI routing map, dependencies, and known fallbacks. |
| Wizard architecture | [wizard/ARCHITECTURE.md](./wizard/ARCHITECTURE.md) | Target design for the dynamic wizard experience and shared state. |
| Rebuild plan | [roadmap/WIZARD_REBUILD_PLAN.md](./roadmap/WIZARD_REBUILD_PLAN.md) | Workstream sequencing and ownership for the compliant relaunch. |
| TitlePoint integration | [titlepoint-failproof-guide.md](./titlepoint-failproof-guide.md) | Tested recipe for talking to the upstream data provider without outages. |

## Getting Started
- Start with the catastrophe report to internalize the compliance guardrails.
- Cross-check backend routes against the architecture plan before modifying the wizard.
- Keep the rebuild plan open while planning sprints; update it whenever scope changes.

## Historical Material
- Legacy implementation guides, marketing collateral, and one-off runbooks now live in [`archive/legacy-2025/`](./archive/legacy-2025/). Use them only when you need background on a deprecated flow.
- The original teardown that initiated the reset remains in [`archive/2025-overhaul/`](./archive/2025-overhaul/).

All other documents in this repository are archival; if you require a new reference, create it alongside the canon above rather than reviving legacy files.
