# üöÄ New Agent Onboarding Guide
**DeedPro AI-Powered Legal Document Platform**

---

## üëã **Welcome!**

This guide will get you up to speed on the DeedPro platform in **30 minutes**. Follow this reading order exactly.

---

## üìñ **READING ORDER** (30 minutes)

### **Phase 1: Understand the "Why"** (5 minutes)
**Purpose**: Learn what problems we're solving and why this rebuild matters.

1. **[README.md](../README.md)** - Project overview and quick start
2. **[wizard-catastrophes.md](./wizard-catastrophes.md)** - Critical failures that drove the rebuild
   - Legal compliance issues
   - UX disasters
   - Why we can't skip steps

**Key Takeaway**: We're rebuilding because the old system had critical legal and UX flaws. Compliance is non-negotiable.

---

### **Phase 2: Learn the Architecture** (10 minutes)
**Purpose**: Understand how the system is designed to work.

3. **[wizard/ARCHITECTURE.md](./wizard/ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Dynamic Wizard Architecture
   - Document selection ‚Üí Wizard flow
   - Metadata-driven rendering
   - Centralized state management
   - Backend integration map

4. **[backend/ROUTES.md](./backend/ROUTES.md)** - Backend API structure
   - FastAPI routers and endpoints
   - Authentication requirements
   - Known gaps and fallbacks

**Key Takeaway**: We use a **metadata-driven dynamic wizard** that fetches document types from the backend. The frontend renders based on backend configuration.

---

### **Phase 3: Understand the Plan** (10 minutes)
**Purpose**: Learn the phased rebuild strategy and current status.

5. **[roadmap/WIZARD_REBUILD_PLAN.md](./roadmap/WIZARD_REBUILD_PLAN.md)** - Master rebuild plan
   - 5-phase approach
   - Exit criteria for each phase
   - Rollback checkpoints
   - Deployment strategy

6. **[roadmap/PROJECT_STATUS.md](./roadmap/PROJECT_STATUS.md)** - Current status
   - What's complete
   - What's in progress
   - What's blocked
   - Next milestones

**Key Takeaway**: We're following a **5-phase plan** with clear objectives, tests, and rollback points. Never deviate from the plan without documentation.

---

### **Phase 4: Know the Tools** (5 minutes)
**Purpose**: Learn where to find tools, scripts, and references.

7. **[DOCS_INDEX.md](./DOCS_INDEX.md)** - Master documentation index
   - All documentation organized by topic
   - Quick reference for common tasks
   - Tool locations

8. **[roadmap/TESTING_GUIDE.md](./roadmap/TESTING_GUIDE.md)** - Testing approach
   - Cypress E2E tests
   - Manual testing procedures
   - Authentication testing

**Key Takeaway**: All tools are documented. Check the index before creating new scripts or documents.

## üéØ **YOUR FIRST TASKS**

After reading the above, you should:

### **1. Verify Your Understanding** (5 minutes)
Can you answer these questions?
- ‚úÖ Why was the wizard rebuilt?
- ‚úÖ What is the Dynamic Wizard Architecture?
- ‚úÖ What are the 5 phases of the rebuild?
- ‚úÖ Where is the backend API documented?
- ‚úÖ What's the current project status?

### **2. Check Current Phase** (2 minutes)
- Read **[roadmap/PROJECT_STATUS.md](./roadmap/PROJECT_STATUS.md)**
- Identify current phase and blockers
- Review your assigned tasks

### **3. Set Up Your Environment** (15 minutes)
```bash
# Clone repository (if not done)
git clone https://github.com/easydeed/new-front.git
cd new-front

# Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend
npm install

# Install backend dependencies (Python 3.11+)
cd ../backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy environment files
cp env.example .env
cd ../frontend
cp env.example .env.local

# Configure environment variables
# See README.md for required values
```

### **4. Run Local Development** (5 minutes)
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev

# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

### **5. Run Tests** (5 minutes)
```bash
# Backend tests
cd backend
pytest

# Frontend tests
cd frontend
npm run test

# Cypress E2E tests (requires dev server running)
npm run cypress:open
```
