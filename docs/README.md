# üåê DeedPro Documentation Hub (2025 Reset)

The documentation set now mirrors the narrow slice of work that remains after the failed wizard relaunch. Only the records below are considered living guidance; everything else has been sequestered for historical reference.

## Core References
- **Crisis Report** ‚Äî [wizard-catastrophes.md](./wizard-catastrophes.md) documents the compliance breaches and UX failures that forced the rebuild mandate.
- **Backend Routes** ‚Äî [backend/ROUTES.md](./backend/ROUTES.md) is the canonical FastAPI map for every authenticated and public endpoint the wizard relies on.
- **Wizard Architecture** ‚Äî [wizard/ARCHITECTURE.md](./wizard/ARCHITECTURE.md) captures the target state for the dynamic flow, state store, and API integrations we still need to finish.
- **Rebuild Plan** ‚Äî [roadmap/WIZARD_REBUILD_PLAN.md](./roadmap/WIZARD_REBUILD_PLAN.md) outlines the sequencing required to ship a compliant replacement.
- **TitlePoint Integration** ‚Äî [titlepoint-failproof-guide.md](./titlepoint-failproof-guide.md) remains the only vetted playbook for working with the upstream data provider.

## How to Use This Folder
1. **Read the catastrophe summary first** to understand the legal guardrails and UX gaps we must not repeat.
2. **Audit the backend routes** so every wizard touchpoint and downstream automation has an identified handler.
3. **Reconcile the architecture plan with the rebuild roadmap** before committing new work; any deviation needs an explicit update to the roadmap doc.
4. **Consult the TitlePoint integration guide** whenever adding, testing, or mocking property data flows.

## Active Subdirectories
- `backend/` ‚Äì Route-by-route API documentation, including auth requirements and fallback behavior.
- `wizard/` ‚Äì Target architecture for the dynamic wizard experience and supporting state models.
- `roadmap/` ‚Äì The authoritative rebuild plan owned by engineering leadership.
- `archive/` ‚Äì Frozen historical material. Use only for context when updating the living docs above.

## Historical Material
- [`archive/legacy-2025/`](./archive/legacy-2025/) contains every prior root-level guide, runbook, and marketing one-pager preserved for posterity.
- [`archive/2025-overhaul/`](./archive/2025-overhaul/) retains the earlier architecture teardown that justified the reset.

If a question is not answered by the five core references, assume the work is either unfinished or requires new documentation before implementation proceeds.
