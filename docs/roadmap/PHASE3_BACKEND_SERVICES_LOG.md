# Phase 3 Backend Services & Routes Log

This log documents every change made during Phase 3 of the Wizard Rebuild Plan - Backend Services & Routes. Each entry records the backend implementation work, route development, and testing outcomes to enable easy backtracking when issues arise.

## Phase 3 Objectives (Per Wizard Rebuild Plan)

- Finalize the `/generate/grant-deed-ca` FastAPI route per the Grant Deed Route Implementation doc
- Extend orchestration services in `backend/api` to support multi-document generation and AI assist prompts
- Harden template rendering logic with validation and logging

## Phase 3 Exit Criteria

- [x] Route handlers in `backend/routers/deeds.py` pass contract tests and align with documentation
- [x] AI assist workflow in `backend/api/ai_assist.py` orchestrates prompts without timeout regressions
- [x] Template rendering includes schema validation and error instrumentation

- **Timeout Handling**: Configurable timeouts, graceful degradation
- **Caching**: Response caching for repeated prompts

### Multi-Document Generation
- **Architecture**: Extensible document type registry
- **Templates**: Jinja2 templates per document type

- **Audit Trail**: Complete generation history logging

## Feature Flag Configuration

### Development Environment
```bash
# Backend flags
DYNAMIC_WIZARD_ENABLED=true
BACKEND_LOGGING_LEVEL=DEBUG
TEMPLATE_VALIDATION_STRICT=true
AI_ASSIST_TIMEOUT=30
PDF_GENERATION_TIMEOUT=60
```

### Staging Environment
```bash
# Backend flags
DYNAMIC_WIZARD_ENABLED=true
BACKEND_LOGGING_LEVEL=INFO
TEMPLATE_VALIDATION_STRICT=true
AI_ASSIST_TIMEOUT=20
PDF_GENERATION_TIMEOUT=45
```

### Production Environment
```bash
# Backend flags
DYNAMIC_WIZARD_ENABLED=false          # Keep disabled until Phase 5
BACKEND_LOGGING_LEVEL=WARNING
TEMPLATE_VALIDATION_STRICT=true
AI_ASSIST_TIMEOUT=15
PDF_GENERATION_TIMEOUT=30
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (pytest)
- [ ] FastAPI route handler tests covering success and failure paths
- [ ] Template rendering utilities with mock data
- [ ] Schema validation tests for all document types
- [ ] Error handling and timeout scenarios
- [ ] AI assist prompt orchestration logic

### Integration Tests
- [ ] API workflow tests invoking `/generate/grant-deed-ca` with mocked dependencies
- [ ] Database read/write checks if persistence introduced
- [ ] TitlePoint integration with AI assist workflow
- [ ] End-to-end document generation pipeline
- [ ] Performance tests for template rendering

### End-to-End Tests (Cypress)
- [ ] Wizard-driven deed generation flow
- [ ] Backend responses populate review step correctly
- [ ] Error states display appropriate user messages
- [ ] PDF download and validation
- [ ] Multi-document type generation flows

## Rollback Plan

### Immediate Rollback (< 5 minutes)
1. Toggle backend feature flags:
   ```bash
   DYNAMIC_WIZARD_ENABLED=false
   ```
2. Verify legacy wizard functionality

### Database Rollback (< 30 minutes)
1. Restore database snapshot if writes were introduced
2. Revert Alembic migrations if applicable
3. Verify data integrity

### Full Rollback (< 30 minutes)
1. Revert to last-known-good commit hash: `TBD`
2. Redeploy previous Render container image
3. Verify all backend routes functional
4. Run smoke tests to confirm rollback success

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Key Metrics to Track
- [ ] `/generate/grant-deed-ca` response times and error rates
- [ ] AI assist workflow completion rates and timeouts
- [ ] Template rendering performance and failure rates
- [ ] PDF generation success rates and file sizes
- [ ] Database query performance (if persistence added)

### Alert Thresholds
- [ ] Route response time > 10 seconds
- [ ] Route error rate > 5%
- [ ] AI assist timeout rate > 10%
- [ ] Template rendering failure rate > 2%
- [ ] PDF generation failure rate > 1%

## Database Schema Changes

### New Tables (if applicable)
