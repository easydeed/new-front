## 📋 ENHANCEMENT CHECKLIST

### **Enhancement #1: Add Sidebar to Create Deed Page** 🔄 IN PROGRESS

**Issue**: Document selection page (`/create-deed`) lacks sidebar, feels disconnected from app  
**Impact**: HIGH - Inconsistent UX, navigation confusion  
**Risk**: LOW - Minimal code changes  
**Implementation Time**: 15 minutes

**Changes Required**:
1. ✅ Import `Sidebar` component
2. ✅ Import `dashboard.css` for consistent styling
3. ✅ Wrap content in flex layout pattern
4. ✅ Adjust container width from `max-w-4xl` to `max-w-5xl`
5. ✅ Remove custom gradient background
6. ✅ Test navigation and document selection

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/app/create-deed/page.tsx`

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Sidebar visible on Create Deed page
- ✅ All sidebar navigation links work
- ✅ Document cards display correctly in narrower content area
- ✅ Grid layout remains responsive (3 columns on large screens)
- ✅ No visual regressions in card styling
- ✅ Clicking cards still navigates to wizard

**Testing Checklist**:
- [ ] Load `/create-deed` page
- [ ] Verify sidebar is visible
- [ ] Click each sidebar link (Dashboard, Shared Deeds, Admin, etc.)
- [ ] Return to `/create-deed`
- [ ] Verify all 5 deed types display correctly
- [ ] Click each deed type card
- [ ] Verify wizard loads for each type
- [ ] Test responsive breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop)

**Rollback Plan**:
```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
git push origin main
```

### **Enhancement #2: Audit Database Endpoints for Transaction Safety** ⏳ PENDING

**Issue**: Multiple endpoints missing `conn.rollback()` in exception handlers, causing transaction cascade failures  
**Impact**: CRITICAL - Server crashes when any database query fails  
**Risk**: HIGH - Affects stability  
**Implementation Time**: 30 minutes

**Background**:
- October 13: Fixed `/approve/{token}` endpoint (Rejection Bundle)
- October 14: Server crashed due to `/pricing` and `/users/login` missing rollback
- Found 88 exception handlers in `backend/main.py` - need systematic audit

**Audit Strategy**:
1. ✅ Identify all endpoints that use database connections
2. ✅ Check each exception handler for `conn.rollback()`
3. ✅ Add rollback where missing
4. ✅ Test each fixed endpoint
5. ✅ Deploy incrementally (one commit per group)

**Endpoints Already Fixed**:
- ✅ `/approve/{token}` (Oct 13)
- ✅ `/pricing` (Oct 14)
- ✅ `/users/login` (Oct 14)
- ✅ `/users/register` (has rollback)

**Endpoints to Audit** (Priority order):
1. 🔴 `/deeds/*` - High traffic, critical functionality
2. 🔴 `/admin/*` - Admin operations
3. 🟡 `/users/*` - User management (except login/register)
4. 🟡 `/shared-deeds` - Sharing functionality
5. 🟢 `/pricing/plans` - Secondary pricing endpoint
6. 🟢 Other miscellaneous endpoints

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ All database-using endpoints have rollback in exception handlers
- ✅ No more "current transaction is aborted" errors
- ✅ Server remains stable under error conditions
- ✅ Documentation updated with findings

**Testing Checklist**:
- [ ] Simulate database errors for each fixed endpoint
- [ ] Verify rollback prevents cascade failures
- [ ] Confirm endpoints return proper error responses
- [ ] Monitor Render logs for transaction errors

**Rollback Plan**:
```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
git push origin main
```
