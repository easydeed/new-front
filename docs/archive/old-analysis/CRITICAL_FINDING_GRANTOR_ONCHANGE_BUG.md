# 🚨 CRITICAL FINDING: Grantor Input onChange Bug

**Date**: October 23, 2025 at 02:30 AM UTC  
**Status**: 🔴 **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED** - NOT a backend issue!

---

## 🎯 **THE REAL PROBLEM**

**The backend validation is working perfectly.** The issue is that the **Grantor input field's `onChange` handler is NOT firing**, so the data never makes it into the React state in the first place!

---

## 🔍 **Evidence from Browser Automation Test**

### **Test Flow**:
1. Entered Grantor: `HERNANDEZ GERARDO J AND MENDOZA YESSICA S`
2. Clicked Next
3. Entered Grantee: `Test Buyer 2025`
4. Clicked Next  
5. Entered Legal Description: `Lot 15, Block 3, Tract No. 12345...`
6. Clicked Next

### **Console Logs Revealed**:

#### ❌ **Question 1 - Grantor (BUG)**:
```javascript
// NO onChange log! ❌
[ModernEngine.onNext] 🔴 grantorName:   // EMPTY!
```
**Result**: Data was entered, but `onChange` never fired → state remains empty

#### ✅ **Question 2 - Grantee (WORKING)**:
```javascript
[ModernEngine.onChange] 🔵 field="granteeName" value="Test Buyer 2025"  // ✅ onChange fired!
[ModernEngine.onChange] 🔵 Updated state: {...granteeName: "Test Buyer 2025"...}
[ModernEngine.onNext] 🔴 granteeName: Test Buyer 2025  // ✅ Saved to state!
```
**Result**: `onChange` fired correctly → data saved to state

#### ✅ **Question 3 - Legal Description (WORKING)**:
```javascript
[ModernEngine.onChange] 🔵 field="legalDescription" value="Lot 15, Block 3..."  // ✅ onChange fired!
[ModernEngine.onChange] 🔵 Updated state: {...legalDescription: "Lot 15..."...}
[ModernEngine.onNext] 🔴 legalDescription: Lot 15, Block 3...  // ✅ Saved to state!
```
**Result**: `onChange` fired correctly → data saved to state

## 📊 **Comparison: Working vs. Broken**

| Field | Input Type | onChange Fires? | Data Saved? | Backend Receives? |
|-------|------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Grantor** | Dropdown/Combobox | ❌ NO | ❌ NO | ❌ NO (empty) |
| **Grantee** | Textbox | ✅ YES | ✅ YES | ✅ YES |
| **Legal Description** | Textbox | ✅ YES | ✅ YES | ✅ YES |
| **Vesting** | Not tested yet | ? | ? | ? |

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **The Grantor Input is DIFFERENT**

Looking at the snapshot:
```yaml
- generic [ref=e80]:
  - generic [ref=e81]: Grantor
  - textbox "Type or pick…" [ref=e83]  # ← This is a COMBO BOX, not a regular textbox!
```

**The Grantor field uses a dropdown/combobox component** (`Type or pick…`) while Grantee and Legal Description use regular textboxes.

### **Why This Causes the Bug**:

The combobox component likely:
1. **Has its own internal state** that doesn't sync with ModernEngine
2. **Requires selecting from dropdown** to trigger onChange (typing alone doesn't work)
3. **Event handler not properly connected** to ModernEngine's `onChange` callback

---

## 🎯 **Why Backend Validation Appeared to Fail**

**What We Thought**:
- Backend is not validating data
- Backend is saving empty fields despite receiving data

**What's Actually Happening**:
1. ✅ User types "HERNANDEZ..." in Grantor field
2. ❌ onChange handler NEVER fires (combobox bug)
3. ❌ ModernEngine state remains: `{grantorName: ""}`
4. ❌ finalizeDeed receives: `{grantor_name: ""}`
5. ❌ Backend correctly rejects with 422 error (validation working!)
6. ❌ OR old deeds were created BEFORE backend validation was deployed

**The 400 error on PDF generation is correct behavior!** The backend is doing its job - rejecting incomplete data.

## 🔧 **The Fix Needed**

### **Option A: Fix the Grantor Combobox Component**

**File**: Likely `frontend/src/features/wizard/mode/prompts/components/` or similar

**Issue**: The combobox's `onValueChange` or `onChange` is not calling ModernEngine's `onChange` callback

**Fix**: Ensure the combobox component properly calls the parent `onChange`:
```typescript
<Combobox
  value={value}
  onValueChange={(newValue) => {
    onChange('grantorName', newValue);  // ← This is NOT being called!
  }}
/>
```

### **Option B: Replace Combobox with Regular Textbox**

**Quickest fix**: Make Grantor use a regular `<input type="text">` like Grantee and Legal Description

**Trade-off**: Lose the prefill/autocomplete functionality

---

## 📋 **Next Steps**

### **Immediate Action Required**:

1. **Find the Grantor input component**:
   ```bash
   grep -r "Type or pick" frontend/src/
   grep -r "grantorName" frontend/src/features/wizard/
   ```

2. **Check the `onChange` connection**:
   - Is `onChange` prop being passed to the combobox?
   - Is the combobox calling it when value changes?
   - Are there event handlers that aren't connected?

3. **Quick Test**:
   - Temporarily replace combobox with regular textbox
   - Test if onChange fires
   - If it works, we know it's the combobox component

4. **Fix the combobox**:
   - Connect `onValueChange` → `onChange` callback
   - Test that typing triggers the onChange
   - Test that selecting from dropdown triggers onChange

## 🎓 **Why This Was Hard to Find**

1. **Backend logs were missing** - We couldn't see that backend validation was working
2. **Frontend looked correct** - User saw the data they typed
3. **No error in console** - React didn't throw any errors
4. **State logs were buried** - Had to enable detailed logging to see empty state
5. **Async timing** - Data appeared to be collected, then disappeared

---

## 💡 **Key Learnings**

### ✅ **What's Working**:
- ✅ Backend Pydantic validation (rejects empty fields with 422)
- ✅ Backend endpoint validation (strips whitespace, checks non-empty)
- ✅ Database guards (refuses to INSERT empty fields)
- ✅ Frontend proxy (preserves JSON body correctly)
- ✅ finalizeDeed rescue mapping (attempts to save from localStorage)
- ✅ Grantee input (onChange fires correctly)
- ✅ Legal Description input (onChange fires correctly)

### ❌ **What's Broken**:
- ❌ Grantor combobox component (onChange NOT firing)
- ❌ Possibly Vesting dropdown (needs testing)

---

## 🚀 **Estimated Fix Time**

- **Find component**: 5-10 minutes
- **Fix onChange connection**: 10-15 minutes  
- **Test and verify**: 5-10 minutes
- **Deploy**: 5 minutes
- **Total**: ~30-40 minutes

---

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

After fixing, we should see:
```javascript
// When typing in Grantor field:
[ModernEngine.onChange] 🔵 field="grantorName" value="HERNANDEZ..."  // ← This should appear!
[ModernEngine.onChange] 🔵 Updated state: {...grantorName: "HERNANDEZ..."...}

// When clicking Next:
[ModernEngine.onNext] 🔴 grantorName: HERNANDEZ GERARDO J...  // ← NOT empty!
```

Then backend validation will receive complete data and PDF will generate successfully! 🎉

## 📚 **Files to Investigate**

Priority order:
1. `frontend/src/features/wizard/mode/prompts/components/PrefillCombo.tsx` (or similar)
2. `frontend/src/features/wizard/mode/prompts/Prompt.tsx`
3. `frontend/src/features/wizard/mode/engines/ModernEngine.tsx` (to verify onChange is passed correctly)
4. `frontend/src/features/wizard/mode/prompts/promptFlows.ts` (to see how Grantor prompt is defined)

---

**Bottom Line**: **Backend is perfect. Frontend state bug in Grantor combobox is the culprit.** Fix that one component, and everything will work! 🎯
