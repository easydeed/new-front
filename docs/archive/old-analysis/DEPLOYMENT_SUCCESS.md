## ✅ What We Just Deployed

### Canonical V6 Patch - Complete Fix for Modern Wizard Data Flow

**Problem Solved:**
- Frontend was collecting ALL data
- But `[finalizeDeed]` logs never appeared
- Backend received empty fields
- PDF generation failed with 400 errors

**Solution Deployed:**
- **finalizeDeed v6** with rescue mapping from localStorage
- **No-blank-deed guard** prevents database pollution
- **Trace headers** for forensic clarity
- **Preview validation guard** prevents infinite retry loops
- **Single canonical entry point** for consistent transformation

## 🎯 Vercel Deployment

**Status:** 🔄 **IN PROGRESS**

**Expected Timeline:**
- Build start: ~30 seconds after push
- Build time: ~3-5 minutes
- Total time: ~4-6 minutes from now

**Check Status:**
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Or check: https://deedpro-frontend-new.vercel.app
3. Wait for "Deployment Complete" notification

---

## 🧪 TESTING INSTRUCTIONS (CRITICAL!)

### When Vercel Deployment Completes:

**Step 1: Prepare Browser**
```
1. Open https://deedpro-frontend-new.vercel.app
2. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
3. Open Developer Console: F12
4. Filter console by: finalizeDeed
```

**Step 2: Start Modern Wizard**
```
1. Navigate to: Create Deed → Modern → Grant Deed
2. Enter property address: 1358 5th St, La Verne, CA 91750
3. Complete property search (verify SiteX data loads)
```

**Step 3: Complete Q&A Questions**
```
1. Answer each question as prompted
2. Watch console for 🔵 blue logs showing input collection
3. Verify data appears in each step
```

**Step 4: Review Page**
```
1. Should see SmartReview page with ALL your answers
2. Check that fields are NOT empty
3. Button should say "Confirm & Generate"
```

**Step 5: CRITICAL - Click Confirm**
```
WATCH THE CONSOLE CAREFULLY!

You MUST see these logs (in this order):
✅ [ModernEngine.onNext] 🟢 FINAL STEP - Starting finalization
✅ [ModernEngine.onNext] 🟢 Canonical payload created: {...}
✅ [finalizeDeed v6] Canonical payload received: {...}
✅ [finalizeDeed v6] Backend payload (pre-check): {deed_type: "grant-deed", ...}
✅ [finalizeDeed v6] Success! Deed ID: ###

If you DON'T see [finalizeDeed v6] logs, the function is not being called!
```

**Step 6: Preview Page**
```
1. Should redirect to: /deeds/[id]/preview?mode=modern
2. Page should load without errors
3. Should show deed details
4. PDF should generate automatically
```

---

## 🔍 What to Look For (Copy This!)

### ✅ SUCCESS Case:

**Console shows:**
```
[ModernEngine.onNext] 🟢 FINAL STEP - Starting finalization
[finalizeDeed v6] Canonical payload received: {deedType: "grant-deed", ...}
[finalizeDeed v6] Backend payload (pre-check): {
  deed_type: "grant-deed",
  grantor_name: "HERNANDEZ GERARDO J; MENDOZA YESSICA S",
  grantee_name: "[your test name]",
  legal_description: "[your legal description]"
}
[finalizeDeed v6] Success! Deed ID: 123
```

**Then:**
- ✅ Redirects to preview page
- ✅ Preview loads without errors
- ✅ PDF generates successfully
- ✅ No 400 errors

---

### ❌ FAILURE Case 1: No finalizeDeed Logs

**Console shows:**
```
[ModernEngine.onNext] Moving to next step
[ModernEngine.onNext] ========== END ==========
(then nothing - no green logs)
```

**Means:**
- finalizeDeed is NOT being called
- Check for JavaScript errors
- Share full console output

---

### ❌ FAILURE Case 2: Empty Fields

**Console shows:**
```
[finalizeDeed v6] Backend payload (pre-check): {
  deed_type: "grant-deed",
  grantor_name: "",
  grantee_name: "",
  legal_description: ""
}
```

**Means:**
- Canonical transformation lost data
- Rescue mapping failed
- Share the full log output

---

### ❌ FAILURE Case 3: Alert Appears

**Alert says:**
```
Some required fields are missing: grantor_name, grantee_name, legal_description. 
Please review and try again.
```

**Means:**
- No-blank-deed guard is working (good!)
- But data was lost before finalize
- Share console logs before alert

---

## 📝 What to Share After Testing

**Please copy-paste ALL of these:**

1. **All console logs** (especially the finalizeDeed ones)
2. **Any error messages** (red text in console)
3. **Whether page redirected** (yes/no + URL)
4. **Whether PDF generated** (yes/no + any errors)
5. **Any alerts that appeared** (exact text)
6. **Screenshot of console** (if possible)

**You can filter console by typing:** `finalizeDeed`
