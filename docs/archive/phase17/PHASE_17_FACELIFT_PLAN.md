**Date**: October 23, 2025  
**Status**: 🟡 READY TO IMPLEMENT

---

## 📋 What This Changes

### Current Landing Page → New Modern Landing
- ✨ **Brand Colors**: Blue (#2563EB), Accent (#F26B2B), Surface (#F7F9FC)
- ✨ **Modern UI**: Framer Motion animations, shadcn components
- ✨ **Complete Redesign**: Hero, Trust Strip, Features, How It Works, API, FAQ, Footer
- ✨ **Live Copy**: Production-ready marketing content

## 🔄 Rollback Strategy

### Option 1: Git Revert (Recommended)
```bash
# If you don't like it, simply revert the commit
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Branch Restoration
```bash
# We'll work on a feature branch
git checkout main
git branch -D feat/landing-livecopy  # Delete feature branch
```

### Option 3: Manual Backup
Before we start, I'll:
1. ✅ Copy current `frontend/src/app/page.tsx` to `frontend/src/app/_legacy-landing/page.tsx`
2. ✅ Create `ROLLBACK_FACELIFT.md` with restoration instructions

---

## 📦 Dependencies to Install

### NPM Packages:
```bash
npm i lucide-react framer-motion @tailwindcss/typography
```

### shadcn Components:
```bash
npx shadcn@latest add button badge card input
```

---

## 🎨 Files to Modify

1. **`frontend/src/app/page.tsx`** - Replace with new landing page
2. **`frontend/tailwind.config.ts`** - Add brand colors and design tokens
3. **`frontend/package.json`** - Add new dependencies

---

## 🧪 Test Plan

After deployment:
1. ✅ Landing page loads at `/`
2. ✅ "Get Started" button → `/app/wizard`
3. ✅ "Sign in" button works
4. ✅ Animations work smoothly
5. ✅ Responsive on mobile
6. ✅ Dark mode toggle works

---

## 🚀 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Backup Current Landing ✅
```bash
mkdir -p frontend/src/app/_legacy-landing
cp frontend/src/app/page.tsx frontend/src/app/_legacy-landing/page.tsx
```

### Step 2: Create Feature Branch ✅
```bash
git checkout -b feat/landing-livecopy
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
```bash
cd frontend
npm i lucide-react framer-motion @tailwindcss/typography
npx shadcn@latest add button badge card input
```

### Step 4: Update Tailwind Config
Merge brand colors into `frontend/tailwind.config.ts`

### Step 5: Apply New Landing Page
Copy `facelift/app/page.tsx` → `frontend/src/app/page.tsx`

### Step 6: Build & Test
```bash
npm run build
npm run dev  # Test locally
```

### Step 7: Deploy
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat(landing): Modern branded landing page with live copy - Phase 17"
git push origin feat/landing-livecopy
```

### Step 8: Merge or Revert
- ✅ **If you like it**: Merge to main and deploy
- ❌ **If you don't like it**: Delete branch, restore backup

## ⚠️ Potential Issues

### Issue 1: shadcn components not installed
**Solution**: Run `npx shadcn@latest init` first if shadcn isn't set up

### Issue 2: Route conflicts
**Solution**: Current landing is at `/`, new one will replace it. Old routes preserved.

### Issue 3: Missing fonts/assets
**Solution**: New design uses system fonts, no external dependencies

---

## 🎯 Routes Preserved

All existing routes remain unchanged:
- ✅ `/login` - Login page
- ✅ `/register` - Register page
- ✅ `/dashboard` - Dashboard
- ✅ `/create-deed` - Wizard
- ✅ `/app/wizard` - Alternative wizard route (NEW CTA target)
- ✅ All other routes unchanged
