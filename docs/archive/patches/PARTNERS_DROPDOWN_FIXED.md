# Partners Dropdown - FIXED! ✅

## 🎯 **STATUS: DEPLOYED** - Commit `33dc464`

---

## 🐛 **The Problem**

**User Report**: "In Wizard the requested by Dropdown does not show the list of partners. Ideally once a matching letter is typed it should show all those that match and then user can select."

**Root Cause**: The `PrefillCombo` component was **missing filtering logic**. It would:
- Show ALL partners when dropdown opened
- NOT filter them as user typed
- Result: Overwhelming list OR no matches shown

---

## ✅ **The Fix**

### **What Changed in `PrefillCombo.tsx`:**

#### 1. **Separated List Building from Filtering**
**Before:**
```typescript
const list = useMemo(() => {
  // Build merged list (partners + suggestions)
  // This was the ONLY list used
}, [partners, suggestions]);
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Step 1: Build full list
const fullList = useMemo(() => {
  // All partners + suggestions merged
}, [partners, suggestions]);

// Step 2: Filter based on what user typed
const filteredList = useMemo(() => {
  const searchTerm = draft.trim().toLowerCase();
  
  // If nothing typed, show all
  if (!searchTerm) {
    return fullList;
  }
  
  // Filter to matching items
  return fullList.filter(it => 
    it.label.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm)
  );
}, [fullList, draft]);
```

#### 2. **Real-time Filtering as User Types**
- Every keystroke updates `draft`
- `filteredList` recalculates automatically
- Dropdown shows only matching partners

#### 3. **Better UX**
- ✅ Increased z-index from 20 to 999 (prevent overlap)
- ✅ Added border-radius and box-shadow (cleaner look)
- ✅ Better hover colors (brand blue tint)
- ✅ Margin-top for spacing from input
- ✅ Border-top on "Add new" option (visual separation)

#### 4. **Comprehensive Logging**
Added console logs to diagnose:
- Full list length
- Filtered list length
- What user typed
- Dropdown open/close state
- Partners data received

## 🎯 **How It Works Now**

### **Scenario 1: User Focuses Field (No Text)**
1. User clicks "Who is requesting" field
2. Dropdown opens → Shows ALL partners
3. User sees complete list

### **Scenario 2: User Types "joh"**
1. User types "joh"
2. `filteredList` updates → Only "John Doe", "John Smith", etc.
3. Dropdown shows only matching partners
4. User can click to select

### **Scenario 3: User Types "xyz" (No Matches)**
1. User types "xyz"
2. `filteredList` is empty → No partners match
3. If `allowNewPartner` is true → Shows "➕ Add 'xyz'" button
4. User can add new partner manually

### **Scenario 4: User Presses Enter**
1. If filtered list has items → Selects first match
2. If no matches but text exists → Adds as new partner
3. Dropdown closes, value saved

## 📊 **Key Improvements**

### **User Experience:**
- ✅ **Instant feedback**: See matches as you type
- ✅ **Less scrolling**: Only relevant partners shown
- ✅ **Faster selection**: Type few letters → pick from short list
- ✅ **Visual clarity**: Better styling, clear hover states

### **Developer Experience:**
- ✅ **Console logs**: Easy to debug issues
- ✅ **Clean separation**: `fullList` vs `filteredList`
- ✅ **Performance**: `useMemo` prevents unnecessary recalculations
- ✅ **Maintainability**: Clear logic flow

## 🧪 **Testing Checklist**

### **Test 1: Empty Field**
1. ✅ Click "Who is requesting" field
2. ✅ Dropdown should open
3. ✅ Should show ALL partners (if any exist)

### **Test 2: Type to Filter**
1. ✅ Type "jo" in field
2. ✅ Dropdown should show only partners with "jo" in name
3. ✅ List should update as you type each letter

### **Test 3: No Matches**
1. ✅ Type "zzz" (unlikely to match)
2. ✅ Should show "➕ Add 'zzz'" option
3. ✅ Clicking it should add as new partner

### **Test 4: Select from List**
1. ✅ Type to filter partners
2. ✅ Click on a partner name
3. ✅ Field should populate with selected name
4. ✅ Dropdown should close

### **Test 5: Keyboard Navigation**

## 🔍 **Console Output to Expect**

When you use the dropdown, you'll see logs like:
```
[PrefillCombo] {
  fullListLength: 12,
  filteredListLength: 12,
  draft: "",
  open: true,
  partnersLength: 12,
  suggestionsLength: 0,
  firstPartner: "John Doe",
  firstFiltered: "John Doe"
}

[PrefillCombo] onChange: j

[PrefillCombo] {
  fullListLength: 12,
  filteredListLength: 3,
  draft: "j",
  open: true,
  ...
  firstFiltered: "John Doe"
}

[PrefillCombo] Selected: John Doe

[PrefillCombo] Blur - closing dropdown
```
