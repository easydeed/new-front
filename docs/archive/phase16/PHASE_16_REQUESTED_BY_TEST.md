## 🔍 What to Check

### Frontend Console:
Look for these logs:
```
🎯 [finalizeDeed v6] Payload ready
  requested_by: "John Smith - ABC Title Company"
```

### PDF Content:
Look for this section on the generated deed:
```
Requested By: John Smith - ABC Title Company
```

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

- [ ] Wizard accepts input in "Who is requesting the deed?" field
- [ ] Data saves to database (deed record created)
- [ ] PDF generates without errors
- [ ] "Requested By" value appears on the PDF

---

## 🐛 If It Fails

**Possible Issues:**

1. **PDF missing "Requested By":**
   - Check backend logs for the PDF generation endpoint
   - Verify the Jinja2 template includes `{{ requested_by }}`

2. **Database error:**
   - Verify migration ran successfully (you saw SUCCESS message ✅)
   - Check Render logs for database errors

3. **Field not showing in wizard:**
   - Check if partners dropdown is working (Issue #2 from Phase 16)

---

## 📊 Phase 16 Status

### Issues Found:
1. ✅ **FIXED**: Industry Partners Table - Sortable Columns (lower priority)
2. ✅ **FIXED**: Partners Dropdown Not Showing (403 error - added Authorization header)
3. ✅ **FIXED**: Partner Not Appearing on Deed (requested_by field - just deployed!)
4. ⏳ **PENDING**: Legal Description Question Disappearing

**Ready to test! Let me know if the "Requested By" appears on the PDF.** 🎯
