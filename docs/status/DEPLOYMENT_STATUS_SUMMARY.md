## 🔐 **NO BACKEND CHANGES**

```yaml
Backend Status: ✅ STABLE
Last Backend Change: >24 hours ago
Render Deployment: No new deploys triggered
Current Status: 24h+ burn-in continuing

Why No Backend Changes:
  - Cypress auth is frontend-only
  - Test configuration doesn't affect production
  - Backend endpoints already working
  - No new APIs needed
```

## 🎯 **WHAT YOU SHOULD DO NOW**

### **Option 1: Wait & Monitor** (Recommended)
```bash
# Let Vercel finish deploying (~5 mins)
# Then check deployment status at:
# https://vercel.com/your-project/deployments

# Once deployed, verify:
1. Build successful
2. No errors in logs
3. Site accessible
```

### **Option 2: Manual Test** (Optional)
```bash
# After Vercel deploys:
1. Visit staging URL
2. Login with test credentials
3. Navigate to /create-deed
4. Verify document selection appears
5. Test wizard flow manually
```

### **Option 3: Run Cypress** (After Deploy)
```bash
# After Vercel deploys:
cd frontend
npm run dev  # In separate terminal
npx cypress run --spec cypress/e2e/wizard-regression-pack.cy.js

# Capture results for sign-off
```

---

## 🚨 **IF SOMETHING BREAKS**

### **Vercel Build Fails**
```bash
# Check build logs on Vercel dashboard
# Most likely: dependency issue or env vars
# Fix: Update package.json or env vars in Vercel
```

### **Cypress Tests Fail**
```bash
# Most likely: timing issues or accessibility
# Non-critical: Can address post-deployment
# Tests validate functionality, not deployment
```

### **Need to Rollback**
```bash
# Vercel: Instant rollback via dashboard
# Render: No changes, nothing to rollback
# Git: Revert commits if needed
```
