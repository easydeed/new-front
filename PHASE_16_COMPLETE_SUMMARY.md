# Phase 16: Modern Wizard Fixes - Complete Summary

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Date:** October 27, 2025

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ Partners Dropdown Not Showing
**Root Cause:** Multiple issues in the data flow from backend to frontend.

**Fixes Applied:**
- **Backend Router Path:** Corrected API endpoint from `/api/partners/selectlist` to `/partners/selectlist/` (removed `/api` prefix, added trailing slash)
- **Frontend API Route:** Updated `frontend/src/app/api/partners/selectlist/route.ts`:
  - Set `runtime = 'nodejs'` (not edge)
  - Set `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` (prevent caching)
  - Added comprehensive logging
  - Implemented graceful degradation (return 200 with empty array instead of 500)
  - Fixed backend URL path
  
- **PartnersContext:** Updated `frontend/src/features/partners/PartnersContext.tsx`:
  - Fixed field mapping: `p.name` instead of `p.company_name` (backend already maps it)
  - Added extensive diagnostic logging
  - Corrected malformed patch code placement
  
- **PrefillCombo:** Added real-time filtering to show matching partners as user types

**Result:** Partners now load successfully and filter in real-time in the "Requested By" dropdown.

### 2. ✅ Legal Description Not Hydrating
**Root Cause:** Backend was looking for a non-existent direct field instead of the nested object structure.

**SiteX Actual Structure:**
```json
PropertyProfile.LegalDescriptionInfo.LegalBriefDescription = "TRACT # 14688 LOT 2"
```

**What Backend Was Looking For (WRONG):**
```python
profile.get('LegalDescription', '')  # Always returned empty!
```

**Fix Applied:**
Updated `backend/api/property_endpoints.py` to correctly extract from nested object:
```python
legal_info = profile.get('LegalDescriptionInfo', {})
legal_desc = legal_info.get('LegalBriefDescription', '')
```

**Result:** Legal descriptions now correctly populate in wizard from SiteX property data.

### 3. ✅ "Requested By" Not Merging to PDF
**Root Cause:** Backend payload was missing the `requested_by` field mapping.

**Fix Applied:**
Updated `frontend/src/lib/deeds/finalizeDeed.ts` to include:
```typescript
requested_by: state?.requestedBy || canonical?.requestedBy || ''
```

**Result:** "Requested By" field now correctly merges into generated PDF templates.

## Lessons Learned

### 1. API Endpoint Mismatches
- Always verify the **exact path** including trailing slashes
- Check router mounting points in `main.py`
- Frontend proxy routes must match backend router prefixes

### 2. Data Structure Assumptions
- Never assume flat data structures
- Always inspect actual API responses (use production logs)
- Document nested object paths clearly

### 3. Field Name Mappings
- Backend transformations (e.g., `company_name` → `name`) must be understood by frontend
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Add transformation documentation

### 4. Caching Issues
- Vercel caches JavaScript bundles aggressively
- Force rebuilds with trivial changes when needed
- Test with fresh data to avoid cached results

### 5. Diagnostic Logging
- Add comprehensive logging at key transformation points
- Don't gate critical logs behind feature flags
- Log raw data structures for debugging
