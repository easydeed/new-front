# Test Session Notes - October 23, 2025

## Authentication Issue Identified

**Problem**: Browser automation was unable to complete property search due to invalid/missing authentication token.

**Error**: `Property search failed: Error: Authentication required. Please log in again.`

**Impact**: Cannot fetch property details from SiteX, which means we can't test the complete flow with pre-filled data.

---

## What We Learned So Far

### ✅ **Confirmed Working**:
1. Frontend page loads correctly
2. Property address validation works
3. Modern Wizard initializes properly
4. Q&A flow starts (showing question 1 - Grantor)

### ⏳ **Unable to Test** (Due to Auth):
1. SiteX property data retrieval
2. Pre-filled grantor/grantee from property search
3. Complete Q&A flow with real data
4. SmartReview page display
5. PDF generation

---

## Next Steps

1. **User logs out and back in** to refresh authentication token
2. **Test Modern Wizard end-to-end** with valid auth
3. **Watch console logs** for:
   - `[ModernEngine.onChange]` - Are all inputs firing onChange?
   - `[ModernEngine.onNext]` - What's in state when moving between questions?
   - `[finalizeDeed v6]` - Is the payload complete?
   - Backend logs in Render - Are fields being received?

## Key Question to Answer

**Does data appear on SmartReview page?**
- If YES → Backend is the issue (validation not working)
- If NO → Frontend state management is the issue

**User said**: "We know that the information is being passed through because it appears on the review page."

This suggests the data IS being captured by the frontend! So the issue is likely:
- Backend not receiving it (proxy issue)
- Backend receiving but not validating (our fix should address this)
- Backend saving empty despite receiving data

---

## Status

**PAUSED** - Waiting for user to re-authenticate and continue testing manually.

**Current Branch**: `main` (Backend Hotfix V1 deployed)

**Ready to Test**: Yes, once authentication is valid
