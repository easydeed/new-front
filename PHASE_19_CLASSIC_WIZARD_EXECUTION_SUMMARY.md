## 🎯 THE REFINED PLAN (Ready to Execute)

**Document**: `PHASE_19_CLASSIC_WIZARD_REFINED_PLAN.md`  
**Confidence**: 95%  
**Total Time**: 8-10 hours (phased execution)

### 5 Independent Phases:

| Phase | Task | Time | What Gets Fixed |
|-------|------|------|-----------------|
| **19a** | SiteX Hydration | 2h | Classic gets property data from SiteX (not TitlePoint) |
| **19b** | PDF Endpoints | 1.5h | Each deed type generates correct PDF (not Grant fallback) |
| **19c** | Context Adapters | 1.5h | Add `requested_by` field to all adapters |
| **19d** | Partners Proxy | 2h | Partners dropdown works (same as Modern) |
| **19e** | Template Headers | 2h | "RECORDING REQUESTED BY" appears in PDFs |

---

## 💪 KEY IMPROVEMENTS OVER ORIGINAL PLAN

| Aspect | Original | Refined | Why Better |
|--------|----------|---------|------------|
| **SiteX Mapping** | Generic guessing | Modern's exact mapping | ✅ Proven to work |
| **Verification** | File checks only | Functional tests | ✅ Tests it actually works |
| **Template Injection** | Auto-inject blindly | Manual review first | ✅ Safer, no surprises |
| **Phasing** | All-or-nothing | 5 independent phases | ✅ Can stop/test anytime |
| **Rollback** | File restore only | File + Git options | ✅ Multiple safety nets |
| **PDF Endpoints** | Local function | Shared map | ✅ Single source of truth |
| **Partners** | New component | Reuse PrefillCombo | ✅ Less code, proven |

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS (When Ready to Execute)

1. **Review** the refined plan with user (confirm approach)
2. **Execute Phase 19a** - SiteX Hydration (most critical)
3. **Test thoroughly** - Verify data flows correctly
4. **Execute Phase 19b-d** - PDF endpoints, adapters, partners
5. **Execute Phase 19e** - Template headers (with manual review)
6. **Final verification** - Test all 5 deed types end-to-end
7. **Deploy & Document** - Update PROJECT_STATUS, commit

## 📋 VERIFICATION AT EACH PHASE

Each phase includes:
- ✅ **Automated verification script** - Checks files/syntax
- ✅ **Functional tests** - Actually tests it works
- ✅ **Manual testing checklist** - User validation
- ✅ **Rollback plan** - Individual phase rollback
- ✅ **Backup files** - `.bak.p19[a-e]` created
