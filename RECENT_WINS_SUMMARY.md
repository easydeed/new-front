## 🎓 **KEY LEARNINGS**

### **From Phase 22-B (External API)**:
- HMAC-SHA256 webhook validation is critical
- S3 presigned URLs better than direct storage
- Retry logic with exponential backoff prevents data loss
- Rate limiting protects against abuse
- Admin bootstrap secret for security

### **From Phase 23-B (Billing)**:
- Stripe webhooks need proper signature verification
- MRR/ARR calculations require careful date handling
- Invoice tracking separate from payment history
- Usage events enable flexible billing models
- Credits system for API partner flexibility

### **From Phase 24-A (V0 Landing)**:
- **Critical**: Next.js 15 bundles CSS globally, even across route groups
- **Critical**: Universal selectors (`*`, `h1 *`) cascade aggressively
- **Critical**: Child layouts don't prevent parent CSS cascade
- **Solution**: When replacing design system, delete old CSS completely
- **Future**: For coexistence, scope selectors with `body:not([data-v0-page])`
- **Lesson**: Simple solutions often best - don't over-engineer!

### **From User Guidance**:
- "Slow and steady, document to debug" → Critical for backtracking
- "It's critical that we learn, document, so we can follow a proven method" → Why we preserve failed attempts
- "We are going in a different direction anyway" → Why deletion worked
- "This will be much, much harder for our internal pages" → Phase 24-B/C prep

## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS**

### **Phase 24-A Finalization**:
1. ⏳ Visual QA: Test all 13 sections
2. ⏳ Mobile responsive testing
3. ⏳ Enable Feature Flag
4. ⏳ Deploy to Vercel
5. ⏳ Lighthouse audit (target: 90+)

### **Phase 24-B: Dashboard Facelift**:
- ⏳ Awaiting V0 prompts from user
- ⏳ Will be harder than landing (complex state)
- ⏳ Apply lessons from Phase 24-A

### **Phase 24-C: Wizard Facelift**:
- ⏳ Awaiting V0 prompts from user
- ⏳ Most complex (critical business logic)
- ⏳ May need hybrid approach
