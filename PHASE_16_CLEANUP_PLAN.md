## üéØ Three Issues to Address

### Issue #1: Partners 403 Error (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Status**: üî¥ INVESTIGATING

**Symptoms**:
- Console shows: `GET /partners/selectlist/ HTTP/1.1" 403 Forbidden`
- Appears repeatedly in logs
- Does not block core functionality but creates noise

**Expected Behavior**:
1. Partners added via Modern Wizard should save to database
2. Saved partners should appear in dropdown for "Requested By" field in future uses
3. No 403 errors

**Current Behavior**:
- Need to investigate authentication/authorization

### Issue #2: Legal Description Question Disappearing
**Status**: üü° NEEDS INVESTIGATION

**Symptoms**:
- Legal description question sometimes doesn't appear
- User can't edit/update legal description when it's pre-filled with "Not available"

**Expected Behavior**:
- If SiteX returns "Not available" or empty ‚Üí Show text input field
- User should be able to type/edit legal description
- Question should remain visible until user fills it or confirms

**Current showIf Logic** (promptFlows.ts line 44-49):
```typescript
showIf: (state: any) => {
  const legal = (state?.legalDescription || '').toString();
  const ok = legal.trim() !== '' && legal !== 'Not available';
  console.log('[Prompt.legalDescription.showIf] üìú legal:', legal, 'SHOW:', !ok);
  return !ok;
}
```

**Analysis**:
- Shows question when legal is EMPTY or "Not available"
- Hides question when legal has actual content
- Need to verify this is working correctly

**Deed Types to Test**:
1. ‚úÖ Grant Deed (tested and working)
2. ‚è≥ Quitclaim Deed
