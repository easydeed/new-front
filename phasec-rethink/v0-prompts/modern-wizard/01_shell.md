# V0 Prompt — Modern Wizard Shell (Visual Only)

**Goal**: Redesign the visual shell (containers, spacing, typography) of our modern wizard.
**DO NOT** change any business logic, handlers, or data flow.

- Tech: Next.js App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind (utility), no external fonts.
- Theme: light, minimal contrast shifts, smooth transitions; accent purple `#7C4DFF`, accent blue `#4F76F6`.
- Accessibility: labels → inputs, keyboard focus visible, reduced‑motion friendly.

**Input**: I will paste our current wizard container file(s). Preserve structure and props. Only change classes and static markup for layout.

**Output**:
1) Revised TSX with presentational changes only
2) Short list of what changed (bullets)
