## 🏆 **SUCCESS METRICS**

### **We Will Track**:
- Wizard completion rate (target: +5%)
- Average time to complete (target: -10%)
- Error rate (target: -20%)
- Mobile abandonment (target: -15%)
- PDF generation success (target: 100%)

### **How We'll Know We Won**:
1. ✅ Metrics improve or stay same
2. ✅ Zero functional regressions
3. ✅ 100% PDF generation success
4. ✅ Clean, maintainable code
5. ✅ Single wizard (not multiple)

## 🚀 **HOW TO START**

### **Option A: Read Everything First** (Recommended)
1. Read `00_START_HERE.md` (5 min)
2. Read `01_MASTER_PLAN.md` (15 min)
3. Read `02_PREP_PHASE_GUIDE.md` (10 min)
4. Start executing Prep Phase

### **Option B: Jump Right In**
1. Open `02_PREP_PHASE_GUIDE.md`
2. Follow Step 1 (Backup Everything)
3. Execute step-by-step

### **Option C: Guided Walkthrough**
**Tell me: "Let's start Phase 24-C Prep, Step 1!"**

I'll guide you through EACH step with:
- Exact commands to run
- What to look for
- How to verify success
- When to commit

## 💪 **CONFIDENCE LEVEL: 9.5/10**

### **Why This Will Succeed**:
1. ✅ **Clean foundation** (Prep phase removes technical debt)
2. ✅ **UI-only changes** (no logic touched = low risk)
3. ✅ **Feature flag** (instant rollback if needed)
4. ✅ **Comprehensive testing** (Playwright E2E + Manual QA)
5. ✅ **Data-driven** (telemetry guides decisions)
6. ✅ **Gradual rollout** (5% → 100%, can stop anytime)
7. ✅ **Clear documentation** (easy to debug)

### **What Could Go Wrong** (and how we handle it):
1. **V0 UI breaks something** → Feature flag OFF (< 2 min)
2. **Performance regression** → Rollback to baseline (< 17 min)
3. **User confusion** → Metrics show it, rollback, iterate
4. **Integration issues** → Each component behind separate flag
5. **Testing misses bug** → Gradual rollout catches it early
